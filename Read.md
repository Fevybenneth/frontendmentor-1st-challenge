## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS 


### What I learned

Participating in these code challenge by Frontend Mentor gave me a chance for a hands on practice as a newbie.
I learnt more about html attributes and elements like
```html
<strong></strong>
<section></section> etc
```
```css
.prep_time{
  background: hsl(330, 100%, 98%);
  padding: 1rem;
  border-radius: 8px;
  margin: 1.5rem 0;
}
.nutrition table{
  width: 100%;
  border-collapse: collapse;
  margin-top: 1rem;
}
.nutrition td{
  padding: 0.75rem 0;
  border-bottom: 1px solid hsl(30, 18%, 87%);

}
.nutrition td:first-child{
  color: hsl(24, 5%, 18%);
}
.nutrition td:last-child{
  font-weight: bold;
  color: hsl(25, 63%, 39%);

}
```

### Continued development
I won't stop. I'll continue to look for new challenges to conquer, I will keep on advancing my knowledge on Html, CSS, Js, Php, hosting websites, creating interactive webpages etc.
